## Technologies

This code is fully developed in C programming language.
To run a c programming you need a compiler.
For Linux you can use GNU GCC and
for windows Turbo C++ IDE / Dev C++ / Borland C Compiler / Code Block/ mingw etc.
MAC users can simply compile it on terminal



## Build and Installation
use the commands below to get the appropriate result:
make clean
make
make run


## Usage

To run the program, there is a makefile that is already designed.
User simply need to type make to build all the dependencies;
Then user will type make run that will give executable files to user
ultimately our user will be having following options to run/check the program:
>bin/fcfs resource/tasks.txt
>bin/sjf resource/tasks.txt
>bin/priority resource/tasks.txt
>bin/rr resource/tasks.txt
>bin/priority_rr resource/tasks.txt
